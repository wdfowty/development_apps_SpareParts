Modded SpareParts by leonnib4 from xda-developers.com for LeoFroYo (Android 2.2 ROM)
<http://android.shk-desktop.com>


I released my sources with some obligations:
- give me credits
- do not say it's only your work
- do not use my repo (change it in sources)

And some things I would (highly) prefer:
- release your source if dev from mine
- do not remove the donate link

HowTo use this code for your ROM:
- change the repo name and URL in res/values/strings.xml


Enjoy ;)
